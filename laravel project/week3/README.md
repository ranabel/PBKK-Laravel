    2. Displayed Pages
    Each page has a clean and simple layout, primarily focusing on textual content with a white background.

            Title: "Home Page".<br>
            Content: A simple message in Indonesian, "Ini adalah Halaman Home Page", which translates to "This is the Home Page."<br>

        - Blog Page <br>

            Active Navigation: The "Blog" menu item is highlighted, showing that this is the current page.<br>
        c. About Page<br>
            Title: "About".<br>
            Content: The page displays "Halaman About" (translated: "About Page"), and below that is a placeholder for user information, showing "Nama: [User Name]", where "[User Name]" would be replaced by the actual name of the user.<br>
            Active Navigation: The "About" link in the navigation is highlighted.<br>
        - Contact Page<br>
            Title: "Contact".<br>
            Content: The page only contains simple text: "Halaman Contact", meaning "Contact Page" in Indonesian.<br>

    3. Design and Layout<br>
        - Minimalist Layout: Each page features a simple design with a white background and black text. The content is displayed in large blocks with ample spacing, creating a clean and readable layout.<br>
        - Color Theme: The site uses a contrast between the white content background and a dark background for the navigation bar.<br>
        - Responsive Design: The design appears to be simple and likely responsive, as there are no complex elements like large images or intricate visual effects.<br>
    4. Possible Purpose<br>
        - Demo or Practice Site: The website seems to be used as a demonstration or a practice project for creating basic website structures. It shows multiple pages with a consistent layout and simple navigation.<br>
        - Placeholder Content: The text on each page seems to be placeholder content, meaning that it's likely to be replaced later with real information.<br>
